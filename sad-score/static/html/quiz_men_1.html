    (Girl version coming as soon as I figure out what the standards are for females on SAD)

    start with 0 points.

    -add 1 for every inch over 5'10 and subtract 1 for every inch below 5'7

    -add 3 points if you are studying engineering, law, or medicine

    -add 3 points if IQ above 130

    -subtract 3 points if IQ below 110

    -add 5 points if 6 figure salary

    -subtract 5 points if you are jobless and not a student

    -subtract 4 points if you aren't a student, aren't jobless, but your job is min wage / retail / hourly type that asian parents would "aiya" at

    -add 4 points if you have, or graduated with, 3.9 GPA or above

    -subtract over 9000 points if you dropped out of school

    -add 3 points for every instrument you are trained classically in.

    -add 3 points if you were first chair of your symphony at some point. Solo instruments, add 3 points if you've won any competitions post-middle school for the instrument

    -add 2 points for varsity or college sports

    -add 3 points for every language you can speak fluently other than english

    -subtract 3 points if you are not fluent in english

    -add 3 points if you have naturally perfect vision

    -subtract 1 point for every tattoo

    -add 2 points if you dress like a fuckboi

    -add 2 points if you have over 10K instagram followers

    -add 3 points if you can be considered a prominent figure in the local asian community

    -subtract 1 point if you can't figure out what number goes in the blank without looking it up: 3.14159265_

    -subtract 10 points if you are racist against other asian cultures

    -subtract 3 points if you really sat here for 10 minutes and scored yourself when you could have been studying/practicing/working out
